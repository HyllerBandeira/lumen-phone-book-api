# Lumen Phone Book API
It's a Lumen based RestAPI that handle a simple Contact CRUD

## Setting up
Check Lumen dependencies at [Lumen website](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs).

## Decision Taken
As I've challanged to develop just a simple CRUD I decided to work with SQLITE database in manor to reduce the needs to start testing.
The SQLITE database it's already on the repository avoinding the need to include him manually.

## Future developments
If I expend more time on this project, I should include validations to improve the security, and split the contact's address info provinding me ability to work better with filters.
